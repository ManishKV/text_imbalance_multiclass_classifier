6,australian oil industry to continue tax campaign the council of the australian petroleum exploration association apea said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to australia s petroleum taxation structure the council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the australian government s position on taxation as presented in a speech by resources and energy minister gareth evans to the apea conference as earlier reported evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum apea had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development the council said it said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by evans but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax rrt legislation evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure the government s unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which rrt applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based the apea council said the government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry s concerns despite its recognition of the industry s problems the council said the industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices reuter

7,analysts see slow move to higher u s prime rate quarter point prime rate increases to pct by citibank and chase manhattan bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the federal reserve s policy intentions economists said based on the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate it probably makes sense for others to follow but no rush is likely said paul mcculley of e f hutton and co citibank s surprise base rate increase quickly followed by chase sent u s bond prices lower and the dollar higher mcculley said that once the spread between three month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than percentage points there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase it has been under points recently however banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term analysts said they noted that banks historically like to follow fed rate movements rather than lead them for example the last prime rate increase occurred in june when banks lifted the rate to pct from pct after a fed discount rate increase in april of that year major banks had been posting a pct prime rate since last august when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the fed s half point discount rate cut to the current pct level on august the banks will not rush to raise their prime rates there should be a split prime for a while with some posting a pct rate and others pct said david jones of aubrey g lanston and co jones said the federal open market committee at today s meeting voted no change in fed policy but he said the fed may well foster higher interest rates soon jones said that while the fomc probably voted no policy change today it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery the fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today s coupon pass said joseph liro of s g warburg and co in a move that came a day earlier than most expected the fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of treasury notes and bonds for its own account this seasonal reserve add is called a pass the fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change said elizabeth reiners economist at dean witter reynolds inc she said the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate is now around basis points compared with a basis point average in reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase the dean witter economist said that today s prime rate rise may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the balance sheet bottom line reiners said that given recent problems with loans to developing countries large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans the federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move in raising their prime rates banks cited a higher cost of funds in the three business days through monday the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly pct but quarter end pressures helped push up funds the fed funds rate was extremely volatile today reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the japanese fiscal year funds traded between five and pct once the special distortions end analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the pct area they said that if it stabilizes near there banks may not quickly boost their prime rates but a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar then banks would lift prime rates quickly reuter

6,opec reaffirms commitment to fixed prices ceiling opec has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of mln barrels per day bpd to defend prices its president rilwanu lukman said he told a news conference here after due consultation with my colleagues in opec i hereby wish to emphasize that nigeria and all member countries of opec remain determined to uphold the december agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices lukman added no extraordinary opec conference was planned we are in a position to re confirm that despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary opec member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of february lukman who is nigerian oil minister said lukman put the overall opec output shortfall in february at bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of dlrs agreed upon last december in geneva the december agreement set an overall output ceiling for opec of mln bpd for first half and restored fixed prices as from february around a reference point of dlrs oil prices rallied immediately after the geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that opec was producing more than the agreed level the idea was to suggest that opec s agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of opec oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs lukman said he said the bpd shortfall last february was based on the verified figure for out of opec s members adding that nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of bpd iraq disassociated itself from the december agreement while the production figures of ecuador and the united arab emirates needed to be verified lukman said if that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed we are ready opec is not changing its price level of dlrs the group s president said he said the opec price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to april had been put off indefinitely furthermore no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in december are being adhered to he said asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various opec crudes fixed in relation to the dlr benchmark lukman replied we consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials lukman said opec was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude we don t see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the dlr price throughout the rest of the year lukman said the opec president praised non opec oil producers which he said had contributed to the group s efforts to stabilise prices but he criticised britain for maintaining its long held view not to do anything to help the market we are quite confident however that in the long term with two thirds of the world s reserves in opec hands the future is ours we will use that advantage responsibly he said lukman described the disruption in ecuador s output following an earthquake as tragic but refused to say if the south american country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster reuter
